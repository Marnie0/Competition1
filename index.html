        <h1>Black Rice</h1>
        <p>
            Black rice, also known as purple rice, is a range of rice types of the species Oryza sativa, some of which
            are
            glutinous
            rice.

            There are several varieties of black rice available today. These include Indonesian black rice, Philippine
            heirloom
            balatinaw black rice and pirurut ong black glutinous rice,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rice#cite_note-prri1-1">[1]</a>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rice#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> and Thai jasmine black
            rice.
            Black
            rice is known as
            chak-hao in Manipur, India.

            In Bangladesh it is known as kalo dhaner chaal (black paddy rice) and used to make polao or rice-based
            desserts.
            The
            bran hull (outermost layer) of black rice contains one of the highest levels of anthocyanins found in
            food.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rice#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The grain
            has a similar amount of fiber to brown rice and, like brown rice, has a mild, nutty taste.<sup><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rice#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

            <h3>One Benefit From Social Media</h3>
            <span>
                Social media is not just about brands connecting with their customers. In fact, at its root, social
                media is
                about
                connecting people to people. If you’ve attended a Social Shift training session I’ve led, chances are
                you’ve
                heard that
                almost every single friend I have in San Francisco, I met through social media.

                From a professional perspective, you can grow your professional network online tremendously by
                connecting
                with
                colleagues, mentors, role models and other professionals. If you nurture those relationships, you have a
                whole new
                network to tap when you’re looking for opportunities or professional guidance.

        <div id="Nam">
            The name for a pyramid in Egyptian is myr. It is written with sign O24 of the Gardner Sign List. Myr is
            preceded by
            three other signs used as phonetics. The meaning of myr is unclear, as it only self-references the built
            object itself.
            By contrast architecture of similar function like 'temple', per-ka, is a compound of 'house' and 'soul'. It
            has been
            speculated myr belongs to a class of words like djed and ankh, which refer to objects already in existence
            when the
            Egyptian language split off from afroasiatic.
