                    culture of
                    hunter-gatherers and fishermen was replaced by a grain-grinding culture. Climate changes and/or

                    around 6000
                    BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated
                    to
                    the
                    Nile River,
                    where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralized society. <sup>[3]</sup>
                    By about 6000 BC, a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley. <sup>[4]</sup> During the Neolithic
                    era,
                    several predynastic
                    cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badari culture and the successor
                    Naqada
                    series are
                    generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site,
                    Merimda,predates
                    the
                    Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with
                    their
                    southern
                    counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining
                    frequent
                    contact through
                    trade. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the
                    predynastic
                    period on Naqada III pottery vessels,
                    dated to about 3200 BC. <sup>[5]</sup>

                    A unified kingdom was formed in 3150 BC by King Menes, leading to a series of dynasties that ruled
                    Egypt
                    for
                    the next
                    three millennia. Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively
                    Egyptian
                    in
                    its
                    religion, arts, language and customs. The first two ruling
                    dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period (c. 2700–2200 BC), which
                    constructed many pyramids, most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty
                    Giza
                    Pyramids.

                    Main articles: New Kingdom of Egypt, Third Intermediate Period of Egypt, and Late Period of ancient
                    Egypt
                    The New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC) began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an
                    international power
                    that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire from from Syria to Upper Nubia. This period
                    is
                    noted
                    for some
                    of the most well known Pharaohs, including Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten and his wife
                    Nefertiti,
                    Tutankhamun and
                    Ramesses II. The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as
                    Atenism,
                    although
                    some[who?] consider Atenism to be a form of monolatry rather than of monotheism. Frequent contacts
                    with
                    other
                    nations
                    brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later ruled and invaded by Libyans, Nubians
                    and
                    Assyrians,
                    but
                    native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country. <sup>[9]</sup>

                    In the sixth century BC, the Achaemenid Empire conquered Egypt. <sup>[10]</sup> The entire
                    Twenty-seventh
                    Dynasty of
                    Egypt,
                    from 525
                    BC to 402 BC, save for Petubastis III and possibly Psammetichus IV, was an entirely Persian-ruled
                    period,
                    with
                    the
                    Achaemenid kings being granted the title of pharaoh.[10] Amyrtaeus' successful rebellion ended the
                    first
                    Achaemenid rule
                    and inaugurated Egypt's last significant phase of independence under native rulers. The Thirtieth
                    Dynasty
                    was
                    the last
                    native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch.[10] It fell to the Persians again in 343 BC after
                    the
                    last
                    native

                    Second Achaemenid conquest
                    The Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Second Egyptian Satrapy, was effectively a
                    short-living
                    province of
                    the Achaemenid Empire between 343 BC to 332 BC. <sup>[11]</sup> After an interval of independence,
                    during
                    which three
                    indigenous
                    dynasties reigned (the 28th, 29th and 30th dynasty), Artaxerxes III (358–338 BC) reconquered the
                    Nile
                    valley
                    for
                    a brief
                    second period (343–332 BC), which is called the Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt, thus starting another
                    period
                    of
                    pharaohs
                    of Persian origin. <sup>[12]</sup>

                    A team led by Johannes Krause managed the first reliable sequencing of the genomes of 90 mummified
                    individuals
                    in 2017.
                    Whilst not conclusive, because of the non-exhaustive time frame and restricted location that the
                    mummies
                    represent,
                    their study nevertheless showed that these Ancient Egyptians "closely resembled ancient and modern
                    Near
                    Eastern
                    populations, especially those in the Levant, and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa. What's
                    more,

                    genetics of
                    the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers—including Nubians, Greeks, and
                    Romans—conquered the
